# How does automated manual testing work in Jira?

## Step-by-Step Explanation of the Features

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are powerful tools for generating text, summarizing, and reasoning through complex tasks. However, when applied to frontend testing, LLMs alone face limitations such as:

1. Install QA365 From [Jira Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?query=qa365&product=jira)
2. Create Your Ticket in the Jira Board with the issue which needs to be tested

3. Switch the status of the ticket to "QA" and we automatically generate test tickets
4. QA365 Automatically generates acceptance criteria based on your ticket and all the functionalities of your webapp
5. After that QA365 automatically starts testing the ticket and checks whether it fulfills all acceptance criteria
6. Every Acceptance Criteria is tested individually. After a success, we upload a gif of all the steps which have been tested. This way you can see what has been done by our software.
7. If there were errors, we submit an error report and notify you that something did not work as it should.
