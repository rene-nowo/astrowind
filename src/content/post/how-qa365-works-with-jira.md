## Step-by-Step Guide to QA365 Features

### 1. Install QA365 from the [Jira Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?query=qa365&product=jira)

Getting started couldn’t be simpler! Navigate to the Jira Marketplace, search for QA365, and install the app directly onto your Jira instance.  


### 2. Create a Ticket on Your Jira Board

Begin by creating a ticket in Jira for the feature or bug you need to test.  

Clearly outline the issue or feature details, ensuring QA365 can fully optimize the testing process.

### 3. Switch the Ticket Status to "QA"

Change the ticket's status to **"QA"** when it's ready for testing. QA365 will take it from here, automatically generating test cases and initiating testing workflows.

### 4. Automatic Acceptance Criteria Generation

This is where the magic happens! QA365 uses AI to analyze your ticket details and the associated web application to **generate precise acceptance criteria automatically**.  

This eliminates guesswork and ensures all key aspects are covered.

### 6. Individual Testing for Every Criterion

QA365 tests **each acceptance criterion separately**. After successful testing, the tool uploads a GIF illustrating all testing steps.  

This visual documentation ensures transparency, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the QA process.
