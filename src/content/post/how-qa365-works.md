# What does QA365 solve?

Modern software development thrives on speed and efficiency. Yet, when it comes to manual testing, the process is often time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks scalability. QA365 bridges this gap by using Graphs and cutting-edge AI to provide automated, reliable frontend testing.

## Why LLMs Like ChatGPT Alone Aren’t Enough

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are powerful tools for generating text, summarizing, and reasoning through complex tasks. However, when applied to frontend testing, LLMs alone face limitations such as:

- **Contextual Understanding:** Frontend applications are dynamic and interactive, requiring real-time engagement rather than static analysis.
- **Visual Validation:** Testing isn’t just about functionality; visuals like layouts and animations are crucial for a seamless user experience.
- **Tool Integration:** A holistic testing process involves not just validating components but pushing actionable results into workflow tools like Jira.
